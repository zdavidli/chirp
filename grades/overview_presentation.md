OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------
**Group 18**

**Evaluator: [Facchinetti, Leandro](mailto:lfacchi2@jhu.edu)**

### Attendance and contribution

All good.

### Overview of project

All good.

### Demo

All good, except for the live retraining with “lalala,” which didn’t work. You understood the sentence I wrote 👍

### Architecture

All good.

### Code review

I’d like to have seen some of the code, particularly the smoothing algorithm, but it’s understandable given the time constraints.

### Presentation organization

All good.

### Talking

All good.

### Quality of slides

All good.

### Project comments emerging during the talk

I’m curious to see how the training will look like in terms of user experience. I suppose it’ll be like training Siri with your voice, but with phonemes instead of full phrases like “hey, Siri.” But you’ll probably also need to render a few phrases to show the user and get some feedback—maybe retrain a few phonemes if their recordings are suboptimal. Also, I guess you’ll need additional controls for things like talking speed, for example. My recommendation is you focus on these aspects first, because they’re more interesting and challenging, and things like Twitter integration can come later.

**Grade:  97/100**

## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 18

**Evaluator: [Suresh, Srinivas](mailto:ssures11.edu)**

### The project idea 
I'm not so sure this can be pulled off in the same fashion you've envisioned it. You guys better start prototyping this really fast to be sure you can do it. Not dinging points for this right now

### Features
Features seem ok, no comment

### UI sketches
UI sketched were not awesome. A lot of stuff that should not have been there. The point of UI sketches is to give people an idea of where key interaction components of your app are and elucidate some workflows. **[-4]**

### Use Cases
Use cases will need to be fleshed out more in the coming iterations

### Architecture
OK for now, please explore more APIs and technologies and nail this down soon.

### General Remarks
Impressed and aprehensive. Please prototype soon.

**Grade: 96/100**

**Evaluator: [Srini Suresh](mailto:ssures11@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including some integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)
Yes, you've made good progress here. Full points.

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)
There is some dodgy code here and there but by and large it is alright. Full points

### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)
Yes. Full points

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?
Yes, decent coverage. Full points

#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)
Yes. Full points

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]
Yes for automated build, no for instructions. Do you expect people to launch the app from an IDE? **-2**

### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed on Heroku or AWS or other?)
Yes. Full points.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)
Could be better, **-2**

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
Poor issue management and changelog contents. Do not accurately represent state of project. **-2**

### Other Remarks
None

**Grade: 94/100**

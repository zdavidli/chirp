# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 18

**Evaluator: [Suresh Kumar, Srini](mailto:ssures11@jhu.edu)**

### Features
I think you have one of the best feature sets among all the groups. Hope to see them materialize.

### UI sketches
UI sketches are still kinda wonky, but your explanation for the same has convinced me, you regain lost points here

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
Woefully inadequate. Needs to be redone. Completely. **-10 points**

### UML Class diagram
Will need to be redone in accordance with your API spec, which is wrong **-5 points**

### Architecture
Nice to see the progress here, I'm sure it will be refined more in the coming iterations

### Initial code
Could not run your proto. But that's okay. Look to see more in the future

#### Initial commit made
Yes, directly or indirectly.

### Other General Remarks
A special requirement for your team in the future will be use of the project board and a mandatory demo of the features you've protoyped ASAP.
Don't worry about the lost points. They can be regained by fixing the highlighted issues.


**Grade: 85/100**

# Iteration 5 Evaluation - Group 18

**Evaluator: [Srini Suresh](mailto:ssures11@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
(Core app working including non-CRUD integration?  Features filling out?  UI starting to look good even though it still may have some glitches?)
Yes, still a lot of moving parts but from what I can see your basic app is up and does what was promised (even if it is kind of weird to listen)

#### Code Quality
(Good use of object-oriented design principles in codebase?  Absence of smells in code?)
Definitely needs to be more object oriented. A lot of your python util code is just giant walls of text. This looks more like an ML/NLP class codebase than an OOSE codebase.
<br/>**-10**

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and improve coverage?)
Good job with the testing.

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
Yes, good job including a script to test.

### Deployment
Yes, no change from last time. 

### Advanced Git usage
Would not say you are git pros, but you have a good git usage.

### Iteration submission and reporting
Finally fixed the API spec. Which was due 2 months ago. 

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iteration 6
Changelog is basically a bunh of fluff and conveys nothing. Also it is out of date. <br/>**-5**

### Other Remarks
None.

**Grade: 85/100**

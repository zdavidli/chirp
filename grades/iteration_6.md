# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 18 Chirp

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Generally good it was.   Some of the technical explanation was not completely clear.

Don't give slides on things you can show in a live demo.

You gave a very good overview of the different models attempted.


#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

Some tweets were doubling (displayed twice), auto refresh was not working well.

Code could be more O-O really - need to refactor it more.

Sound of the two users was a little bit different, but not a lot - algo still needs work.



#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

The UI was majorly redone for demo, which is appreciated. The rebranding was also a good thought. Kudos in this regard.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

Good coverage.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Good Work, no problems.

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

AWESOME!  Heaps of non CRUD

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

All good,

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

Lots of challenging algorithms here.  You didn't quite get to a full app though, need to populate more voices and get voice sharing going.

### Overall Remarks

You guys really pulled off an awesome job in the clutch. Congratulations!
